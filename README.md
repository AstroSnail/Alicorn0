# Alicorn


This repository is the current development site for Alicorn. 

The plan is to implement a bootstrap interpreter using Lua which will then be used to write the compiler in Alicorn itself (or a bootstrap subset thereof), which will talk with an LLVM interface module written in C++ to produce a complete native, self hosting compiler.
